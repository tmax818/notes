* introduction :notes:

In the interest of having a mimimum number of "buckets," This document will serve as a reference for notes. It seems the need for a separate directory for some topics rises immediately (i.e. [[haskell]]).

#+begin_quote
Note sequences occupy the sweet spot between isolated facts/ideas and continuous text. They are what the Zettelkasten is all about. Therefore: Make sure a new note is written, whenever possible, in direct response to an existing note, continuing the dialogue.

If your program allows linking to individual blocks within a page, feel free to write whole note sequences on a single page with each block (or paragraph) as a single note. As long as you treat each block (or paragraph) as a stand-alone note, addressable from anywhere else, you keep the granularity of your notes while benefitting from a better overview over an existing thread.
