In the interest of having a mimimum number of "buckets," This document will serve as a reference for notes. It seems the need for a separate directory for some topics rises immediately as in the case with any programming language.

Whenever I open Emacs, I feel inspired. Like a craftsman entering his workshop, I feel a realm of possibility open before me. I feel the comfort of an environment that has evolved over time to fit me perfectly—an assortment of packages and key bindings that help me bring ideas to life day after day.

Note sequences occupy the sweet spot between isolated facts/ideas and continuous text. They are what the Zettelkasten is all about. Therefore: Make sure a new note is written, whenever possible, in direct response to an existing note, continuing the dialogue.

If your program allows linking to individual blocks within a page, feel free to write whole note sequences on a single page with each block (or paragraph) as a single note. As long as you treat each block (or paragraph) as a stand-alone note, addressable from anywhere else, you keep the granularity of your notes while benefitting from a better overview over an existing thread.
