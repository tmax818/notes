#+title: Newton's Laws

* Newton's first law of motion

An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force. The tendency for an object to maintain its state of rest or constant motion is called inertia.

* Newton's second law of motion

the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to the object's mass. The following equation represents Newton's second law:

 F_{net}= ma
