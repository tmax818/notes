* C code includes pointers 42

* Digging into memory 43

* Set sail with pointers 44

** set sail with pointers

* Try passing a pointer to the variable 47

* Using memory pointers 48

* How do you pass a string to a function? 53

** honey, who shrank the string?

#+begin_src c
  void fortune_cookie(char msg[]){
    printf("Message reads: %s\n", msg);
    printf("msg occupies %i bytes\n", sizeof(msg));
    }
#+end_src

* Array variables are like pointers… 54

** ...so our function was passes a pointer

* What the computer thinks when it runs your code 55

* But array variables aren’t quite pointers 59

** pointer decay

** the case of the lethal list

* Why arrays really start at 0 61

#+begin_src c
  int drinks[] = {4, 2, 3};
  printf("1st order: %i drinks\n", drinks[0]);
  printf("1st order: %i drinks\n", *drinks);  // drinks[0] == *drinks
#+end_src

* Why pointers have types 62

- so that the compiler knows how much to adjust pointer arithmetic.

* Using pointers for data entry 65



* Be careful with scanf() 66

* fgets() is an alternative to scanf() 67

* String literals can never be updated 72

* If you’re going to change a string, make a copy 74

* Memory memorizer 80

* Your C Toolbox 81
