* chapter: getting started with c

** C is a language for small, fast programs
#+begin_quote
C ... creates code that's a lot closer to what machines really understand.
#+end_quote

*** The way C works

- compiler :: gcc converts c code into machine code
- gcc :: the Gun Compiler Collection 

**** source
#+begin_src c
 // rocks.c
  #include <stdio.h>

       int main(){
         puts("C Rocks!");
         return 0;
         }
#+end_src

**** compile
#+begin_src bash
$  gcc rocks.c -o rocks
#+end_src

**** output

#+begin_quote
C is used where speed, space, and protability are important. Most operating systems are written in C. Most other computer languages arre also written in C. And most game software is written in C.
#+end_quote

**** sharpen your pencil

What does the following code do?

#+begin_src c
  int card_count = 11;
  if (card_count > 10)
    puts("The deck is hot. Increase bet.");
#+end_src


#+begin_src c
  int c = 10;
  while (c > 10) {
    puts("I must not write code in class"):
    c = c - 1;
#+end_src

#+begin_src c
  /* Assume name shorter than 20 chars. */
  char ex[20];
  puts("Enter boyfriend's name: ");
  scanf("%19s", ex);
  printf("Dear %s.\n\n\tYou're history.\n", ex);
#+end_src

** but what does a complete c program look like?

** but how do you run the program

** two types of command

** here's the code so far

** card counting? in C?

** there's more to booleans than equals ...

** what the code looks like now?

** pulling the ol' switcheroo

** sometimes once is not enough...

** loops often follow the same structure ...

** you use break to break out ...

** your c toolbox

* chapter: memory and pointers

** C code includes pointers

- pointer :: the address of a piece of data in memory
  - avoid copies and share data

** digging into memory
** set sail with pointers
** try passing a pointer to the variable
** using memory pointers
** how do you pass a string to a function?
** Array variables are like pointers ...
** what the computer thinks when it runs code
** but array variable aren't quite pointers
** why arrays start at 0
** why pointer have types
** using pointers for data entry
** be careful with scanf()
** fgets() is an alternative to scanf()
** string literals can never be updated
** if you're going to change a string, make a copy
** memory memorizer
** your c toolbox


** strings

* chapter: do one thing and do it well

** small tools can solve big problems

** here's how the program should work

** but you're not using files
