#+title: getting started with C: Diving in


* C is a language for small, fast programs  2

** the way C works

- machine code :: 

- compiler :: gcc

#+begin_src c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    puts("C Rocks!");
    return 0;
    }
#+end_src



* But what does a complete C program look like?  5

- source file :: c code file ending in `.c`

#+begin_src c

#+end_src

- main() function :: starting point for all code in the program

* But how do you run the program?  9

- C is a **compiled language** 

* Two types of command  14

** do something

** do something *only* if something is true

* Here’s the code so far  15

- [[file:cards.c][cards.c]]

* Card counting? In C?   17

* There’s more to booleans than equals…   18

* What’s the code like now?   25

* Pulling the ol’ switcheroo   26

* Sometimes once is not enough…   29

** using while loops in C

* Loops often follow the same structure…   30

** ...and for loops make this easy

#+begin_src c
  int counter;
  for(coutner = 1; counter < 11; counter++){
    printf("%i green bottles, hanging on a wall\n", counter);
  }
#+end_src

* You use break to break out…  31

** ...and continue to continue


* bullet points

- a `while` loop
