Welcome to chapter 1, future Tyler.
How long has it been you lazy piece-of-shit!

I have included the creation of the simple 'rocks.c' in the
makefile. All you have to do is run 'make' you pile of
dogshit!!!

Then you have to run `./a.out` Can you remember to do that, fuck-stick?!

You can run the cards program by running 'make cards'.
