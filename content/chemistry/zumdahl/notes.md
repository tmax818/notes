# 1 Chemistry: An Introduction 2

## 1.1 The Science of Chemistry

### Key Terms

Chemistry

- Chemistry is important to everyone because chemistry occurs all around us in our daily lives.
- Chemistry is the science that deals with the materials of the universe and the changes that these materials undergo.
- Chemistry “looks inside” ordinary objects to study how their components behave.

## 1.2 Using Science to Solve Problems

### Key Terms

Scientific method
Theory
Natural law
Measurement


- Scientific thinking helps us solve all types of problems that we confront in our lives.
- Scientific thinking involves observations that enable us to clearly define both a problem and the construction and evaluation of possible explanations or solutions to the problem.
- The scientific method is a procedure for processing the information that flows from the world around us in which we
    - Make observations.
    - Formulate hypotheses.
    - Perform experiments.
- Models represent our attempt to understand the world around us.
    - Models are not the same as “reality.”
    - Elementary models are based on the properties of atoms and molecules.

## 1.3 Learning Chemistry

- Understanding chemistry takes hard work and patience.
- As you learn chemistry, you should be able to understand, explain, and predict phenomena in the macroscopic world by using models based in the microscopic world.
- Understanding is different from memorizing.
- It is okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them.

# 2 Matter 22

## 2.1 The Nature of Matter

### Key Terms

Matter
Atoms
Compounds
Molecule
Elements
Solid
Liquid
Gas

■ Matter has mass and occupies space. It is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
■ Matter exists in three states:
    • Solid—is a rigid substance with a definite shape
    • Liquid—has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container
    • Gas—takes the shape and volume of its container
■ Elements contain only one kind of atom—elemental copper contains only copper atoms, and elemental gold contains only gold atoms.
■ Compounds are substances that contain two or more kinds of atoms.
■ Compounds often contain discrete molecules.
■ A molecule contains atoms bound together in a particular way—an example is, the water molecule, which is written H2O.

## 2.2 Properties of Matter

### Key Terms

Physical properties
Chemical properties
Physical change
Chemical change

■ Matter has both physical and chemical properties.
    • Chemical properties describe a substance’s ability to change to a different substance.
    • Physical properties are the characteristics of a substance that donot involve changing to another substance.
        ◆ Examples are shape, size, and color.
■ Matter undergoes physical and chemical changes.
    • A physical change involves a change in one or more physical properties but no change in composition.
    • A chemical change transforms a substance into one or more new substances.

### 2.3 Classifying Matter

### Key Terms

Mixture
Alloys
Pure substance
Homogeneous mixture
Solution
Heterogeneous mixture
Distillation
Filtration

■ Matter can be classified as a mixture or a pure substance.
    • A mixture has variable composition.
        ◆ A homogeneous mixture has the same properties throughout.
        ◆ A heterogeneous mixture has different properties in different parts of the mixture.
    • A pure substance always has the same composition.
■ Mixtures can be separated into pure substances by various means including distillation and filtration.
■ Pure substances are of two types:
    • Elements, which cannot be broken down chemically into simpler substances
    • Compounds, which can be broken down chemically into elements

### 3.1 The Elements

■ All of the materials in the universe can be chemically broken down into about 100 different elements.
■ Nine elements account for about 98% of earth’s crust, oceans, and atmosphere.
■ In the human body, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen are the most abundant elements.
■ Each element has a name and a symbol.
    • The symbol usually consists of the first one or two letters of the element’s name.
    • Sometimes the symbol is taken from the element’s original Latin or Greek name.

### 3.2 Atoms and Compounds

■ The Law of constant composition states that a given compound always contains the same proportion by mass of the elements of which it is composed.
■ Dalton’s atomic theory states:
    • All elements are composed of atoms.
    • All atoms of a given element are identical.
    • Atoms of different elements are different.
    • Compounds consist of the atoms of different elements.
    • Atoms are not created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.
■ A compound is represented by a chemical formula in which the number and type of atoms present are shown by using the element symbols and subscripts.

### 3.3 Atomic Structure

■ Experiments by J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford showed that atoms have internal structure.
    • The nucleus, which is at the center of the atom, contains protons (positively charged) and neutrons (uncharged).
    • Electrons move around the nucleus.
        ◆ Electrons have a small mass (1/1836 of the proton mass).
        ◆ Electrons have a negative charge equal and opposite to that of the proton.
■ Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
■ A particular isotope is represented by the symbol  A Z X, in which Z represents the number of protons (atomic number) and A represents the total number of protons and neutrons (mass number) in the nucleus.



### 3.4 Using the Periodic Table

■ The periodic table shows all of the known elements in order of increasing atomic number; the table is organized to group elements with similar properties in vertical columns.
■ Most elements have metallic properties (the metals) and appear on the left side of the periodic table.
■ Nonmetals appear on the right side of the periodic table.
■ Metalloids are elements that have some metallic and some nonmetallic properties.


### 3.5 Ions and Their Compounds

■ Atoms can form ions (species with a charge) by gaining or losing electrons.
    • Metals tend to lose one or more electrons to form positive ions called cations; these are generally named by using the name of the parent atom.
    • Nonmetals tend to gain one or more electrons to form negative ions called anions; these are named by using the root of the atom name followed by the suffix -ide.
■ The ion that a particular atom will form can be predicted from the atom’s position on the periodic table.
    • Elements in Group 1 and 2 form 1+ and 2+ ions, respectively.
    • Group 7 atoms form anions with 1- charges.
    • Group 6 atoms form anions with 2- charges.
■ Ions combine to form compounds. Compounds are electrically neutral, so the sum of the charges on the anions and cations in the compound must equal zero.

# 5 Measurements and Calculations 124








### 5.1 Scientific Notation and Units


Measurement
Scientific notation
Units
English system
Metric system
International System (SI)
Volume
Liter
Milliliter
Mass
Gram

■ A quantitative observation is called a measurement and consists of a number and a unit.
■ Very large or very small numbers are conveniently expressed by using scientific notation.
    • The number is expressed as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 and raised to a power.
■ Units provide a scale on which to represent the results of a measurement. There are three commonly used unit systems.
    • English
    • Metric (uses prefixes to change the size of the unit)
    • SI (uses prefixes to change the size of the unit)

### 5.2 Uncertainty in Measurement and Significant Figures

Significant figures
Rounding off

■ All measurements have some uncertainty, which is reflected by the number of significant figures used to express the number. 
■ Rules exist for rounding off to the correct number of significant figures in a calculated result. 

### 5.3 Problem Solving and Unit Conversions

Conversion factor
Equivalence statement
Dimensional analysis
Fahrenheit scale
Celsius scale
Kelvin scale (absolute)
Density
Specific gravity

■ We can convert from one system of units to another by a method called dimensional analysis using conversion factors.
■ Conversion factors are built from an equivalence statement which shows the relationship between the units in different systems.

English-Metric and English-English Equivalents
|        |                                                               |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Length | 1 m = 1.094 yd 2.54 cm = 1 in.1 mi = 5280. ft 1 mi = 1760. yd |
| Mass   | 1 kg = 2.205 lb 453.6 g = 1 lb                                |
| Volume | 1 L = 1.06 qt 1 ft^3  = 28.32 L                               |


■ There are three commonly used temperature scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.
■ We can convert among the temperature scales by adjusting the zero point and the size of the unit. Useful equations for conversions are:
• $°T_C  + 273 = T_K$
• $°T_F  = 1.80(°T_C) + 32$
• Density represents the amount of matter present in a given volume:
  $density = \frac{mass}{volume}$


# 6 Chemical Composition 170






### 6.1 Atoms and Moles


Atomic mass unit
Average atomic mass
Mole
Avogadro’s number

■ Objects do not need to have identical masses to be counted by weighing. All we need to know is the average mass of the objects.
■ To count the atoms in a sample of a given element by weighing we must know the mass of the sample and the average mass for that element.
■ Samples in which the ratio of the masses is the same as the ratio of the masses of the individual atoms always contain the same number of atoms.
■ One mole of anything contains 6.022  10^23 units of that substance.
■ A sample of an element with a mass equal to that element’s average atomic mass (expressed in g) contains one mole of atoms.

### 6.2 Molar Mass and Percent Composition

Molar mass
Mass percent

■ The molar mass of any compound is the mass in grams of one mole of the compound.
■ The molar mass of a compound is the sum of the masses of the component atoms.
■ $Moles of a compound = \frac{mass of the sample (g)}{molar mass of the compound (g/mol)}$
■ Mass of a sample (g)  (moles of sample)  (molar mass of compound)
■ Percent composition consists of the mass percent of each element in a compound:

$ Mass percent = \frac{mass of a given element in 1 mol of a compound}{mass of 1 mol of compound} \times 100% $

### 6.3 Formulas of Compounds

Empirical formula
Molecular formula

■ The empirical formula of a compound is the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms present in the compound.
■ The empirical formula can be found from the percent composition of the compound.
■ The molecular formula is the exact formula of the molecules present in a substance.
■ The molecular formula is always a whole number multiple of the empirical formula.
■ The following diagram shows these different ways of expressing the same information.

| (aq)   | dissolved in water (in aqueous solution) |

■ Chemical reactions involve a rearrangement of the ways atoms are grouped together.
■ A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction.
    • Reactants are shown to the left of an arrow.
    • Products are shown to the right of the arrow.
■ In a chemical reaction atoms are neither created nor destroyed. A balanced chemical equation must have the same number of each type of atom on the reactant and product sides.
■ A balanced chemical equation uses numbers(coefficients) in front of the reactant and product formulas to show the relative numbers of each.

### 7.3 Balancing Chemical Equations

Coefficients

■ A chemical reaction is balanced by using a systematic approach.
    • Write the formulas of the reactants and products to give the unbalanced chemical equation.
    • Balance by trial and error, starting with the most complicated molecule(s).
    • Check to be sure the equation is balanced (same numbers of all types of atoms on the reactant and product sides).

    • A combustion reaction is an oxidation–reduction reaction that involves $O_2$ .
    • A precipitation reaction can also be classified as a double displacement reaction.

# 9 Chemical Quantities 278/335






### 9.1 Using Chemical Equations

Mole ratio

■ A balanced chemical equation gives relative numbers (or moles) of reactant and product molecules that participate in a chemical reaction.
■ Stoichiometric calculations involve using a balanced chemical equation to determine the amounts of reactants needed or products formed in a reaction.
■ To convert between moles of reactants and moles of products, we use mole ratios derived from the balanced chemical equation.

### 9.2 Using Chemical Equations to Calculate Mass

Stoichiometry

■ To calculate masses from the moles of reactants needed or products formed, we can use the molar masses of substances for finding the masses (g) needed or formed.

### 9.3 Limiting Reactants and Percent Yield

Limiting reactant
Theoretical yield
Percent yield

■ Often, reactants in a chemical reaction are not present in stoichiometric quantities (they do not “run out” at the same time).
    • In this case, we must determine which reactant runs out first and thus limits the amount of products that can form—this is called the limiting reactant.
■ The actual yield (amount produced) of a reaction is usually less than the maximum expected (theoretical yield).
■ The actual yield is often expressed as a percentage of the theoretical yield 

$$ percent \ yield = \frac{actual \ yield (g)}{theoretical \ yield (g)}  \times 100% $$

Exothermic
Endothermic

■ Energy is conserved.
■ The **law of conservation of energy** states that energy is neither created or destroyed in any process.
■ In a process, energy can be changed from one form to another but the amount of energy remains constant.
■ Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its changes.
■ Energy is classified as one of the following:
    • Kinetic energy—energy due to the motion of an object
    • Potential energy—energy due to the position or composition of an object
■ Some functions, called state functions, depend only on the beginning and final states of the system, not on the specific pathway followed.
    • Energy is a state function.
    • Heat and work are not state functions.
■ Temperature indicates the vigor of the random motions of the components of that substance.
■ Thermal energy is the sum of the energy produced by the random motions of the components.
■ Heat is a flow of energy between two objects due to a temperature difference between the objects.
    • An exothermic process is one in which energy as heat flows out of the system into the surroundings.
    • An endothermic process is one in which energy as heat flows into the system from the surroundings.
    • The common units for heat are calories and joules.

### 10.2 The Flow of Energy

Thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics
Internal energy
Calorie
Joule

■ Internal energy $(E)$S is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy associated with an object.
• Internal energy(E) can be changed by two types of energy flow:
◆ Heat(q)
◆ Work(w)

•  $\Delta E = q + w$

■ Specific heat capacity is the energy required to change the temperature of a mass of one gram of a substance by one Celsius degree.

### 10.3 Energy and Chemical Reactions

Enthalpy
Calorimeter
Hess’s law

■ For a process carried out at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy(H) of that process is equal to the heat.

Characteristics of H
    • If a reaction is reversed, the sign of  H is also reversed.
    • The magnitude of  H is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants and products in a reaction. If the coefficients in a balanced reaction are multiplied by an integer, the value of  H is multiplied by the same integer.
■ Hess’s law enables the calculation of the heat for a given reaction from known heats of related reactions.
■ A calorimeter is a device used to measure the heat associated with a given chemical reaction.

### 10.4 Using Energy in the Real World

Fossil fuels
Petroleum
Natural gas
Coal
Greenhouse effect
Energy spread
Matter spread
Entropy
Second law of thermodynamics

■ Although energy is conserved in every process, the quality(usefulness) of the energy decreases in every real process.
■ Natural processes occur in the direction that leads to an increase in the disorder (increase in entropy) of the universe.
    • The principal driving forces for natural processes can be described in terms of “matter spread” and “energy spread.”
■ Our world has many sources of energy. The use of this energy affects the environment in various ways.

■ Atomic energy levels are broken down into principal levels(n) which contain various numbers of sublevels.
    • The sublevels represent various types of orbitals (s, p, d, f ) which have different shapes.
    • The number of sublevels increases as n increases.
■ A given atom has Z protons in its nucleus and Z electrons surrounding the nucleus.
■ The electrons occupy atomic orbitals starting with the lowest energy (the orbital closest to the nucleus).
■ The Pauli exclusion principle states that an orbital can hold only two electrons with opposite spins.

    • Ionic: Formed when one or more electrons are transferred to form positive and negative ions
    • Covalent: Electrons are shared equally between identical atoms
        ◆ Polar covalent bond: unequal electron sharing between different atoms
■ Electronegativity is the relative ability of an atom to attract the electrons shared with another atom in a bond.
■ The difference in electronegativity of the atoms forming a bond determines the polarity of that bond.

### 12.2 Characteristics of Ions and Ionic Compounds

■ In stable compounds, atoms tend to achieve the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas atom.
■ In ionic compounds:
    • Nonmetals tend to gain electrons to reach the electron configuration of the next noble gas atom.
    • Metals tend to lose electrons to reach the electron configuration of the previous noble gas atom.
■ Ions group together to form compounds which are electrically neutral.

### 12.3 Lewis Structures

■ In covalent compounds, nonmetals share electrons so that both atoms achieve noble gas configurations.
■ Lewis structures represent the valence electron arrangements of the atoms in a compound.
■ The rules for drawing Lewis structures recognize the importance of noble gas electron configurations.
    • Duet rule for hydrogen
    • Octet rule for most other atoms

Charles’s law
Avogadro’s law

■ The common units for pressure are mmHg (torr), atmosphere(atm), and pascal(Pa). The SI unit is the pascal.
■ **Boyle’s law** states that the volume of a given amount of gas at constant temperature varies inversely to its pressure. $PV = k$
■ **Charles’s law** states that the volume of a given amount of an ideal gas at constant pressure varies directly with its temperature (in kelvins). $V = bT$
    • At absolute zero (0 K; -273 °C) the volume of an ideal gas extrapolates to zero.
■ Avogadro’s law states for an ideal gas at constant temperature and pressure, the volume varies directly with the number of moles of gas (n). $V = an$

### 13.2 Using Gas Laws to Solve Problems

Universal gas constant
Ideal gas law
Ideal gas
Combined gas law
Partial pressure
Dalton’s law of partial 
pressures
Molar volume
Standard temperature and pressure(STP)

■ The ideal gas law describes the relationship among P, V, n, and T for an ideal gas. $PV = nRT$

$$R = (0.08206\frac{L \ atm}{mol \ K})$$

 A gas that obeys this law exactly is called an ideal gas.
■ From the ideal gas law we can obtain the combined gas law which applies when n is constant.

   P 1  V1_____T1 = P2  V2_____T2
■ Dalton’s law of partial pressures states the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the individual (partial) pressures of the gases. $$P_{total} = P_1  + P_2  + P_3  + \dots $$
■ Standard temperature and pressure (STP) is defined as P  1 atm and T  273 K (0 °C).
■ The volume of one mole of an ideal gas (the molar volume) is 22.4 L at STP.

### 13.3 Using a Model to Describe Gases

Kinetic molecular theory

■ The kinetic molecular theory(KMT) is a model based on the properties of individual gas components that explains the relationship of P, V, T,  and n for an ideal gas.
■ A law is a summary of experimental observation.
■ A model (theory) is an attempt to explain observed behavior.
■ The temperature of an ideal gas reflects the average kinetic energy of the gas particles.
■ The pressure of a gas increases as its temperature increases because the gas particles speed up.
■ The volume of a gas must increase because the gas particles speed up as a gas is heated to a higher temperature.

### 14.1 Intermolecular Forces and Phase Changes

■ Intermolecular forces are the forces that occur among the molecules in a substance.
■ The classes of intermolecular forces are
    • Dipole–dipole: due to the attractions among molecules that have dipole moments
    • Hydrogen bonding: particularly strong dipole–dipole forces that occur when hydrogen is bound to a highly electronegative atom (such as O, N, F)
    • London dispersion forces: forces that occur among nonpolar molecules (or atoms) when accidental dipoles develop in the electron “cloud”
■ Phase changes can occur when energy enters or leaves a compound.
    • As energy enters a system a substance can change from a solid to a liquid to a gas.


• The molar heat of fusion is the energy required to melt 1 mol of a solid substance.
• The normal melting point is the temperature at which a solid melts at a pressure of 1 atm.
• The normal boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid boils at a pressure of 1 atm.
• A substance with relatively large intermolecular forces requires relatively large amounts of energy to produce phase changes.
◆ Water is an example of a substance with large intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding).

### 14.2 Vapor Pressure and Boiling Point

■ The equilibrium pressure of vapor over a liquid in a closed container is called the vapor pressure.
■ The vapor pressure of a liquid is a balance between condensation and evaporation.
■ Vapor pressure is relatively low for a substance (such as water) with large intermolecular forces.
■ The boiling point of a liquid occurs at a temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure.


### 14.3 Properties of Solids

■ Types of solids
    • Ionic solid—the components are ions.
    • Molecular solid—the components are molecules.
    • Atomic solids—the components are atoms.
■ Bonding in solids
    • Ionic solids are bound together by the attractions among the oppositely charged ions.
    • Molecular solids are bound together by the intermolecular forces among the molecules.
    • Atomic solids 
◆ The solids produced from noble gases have weak London dispersion forces.
◆ Many atomic solids form “giant molecules” that are held together by covalent bonds
■ Metals are held together by nondirectional covalent bonds (called the electron sea model) among the closely packed atoms.
• Metals form alloys of two types.
    ◆ Substitutional: different atoms are substituted for the host metal atoms.
    ◆ Interstitial: small atoms are introduced into the “holes” in the metallic structure.

### 16.2 Determining the Acidity of a Solution

■ The acidity of a solution is expressed in terms of [ H ].
■ pH   log [ H ]
• Lower pH means greater acidity ([ H ]).
■ pOH   log [O H ]
■ For a neutral solution [ H ]  [O H ].
■ For an acidic solution [ H 
] > [O H ].
■ For a basic solution [ H ] < [O H ].
■ The pH of a solution can be measured by
    • Indicators
    • pH meter
■ For a strong acid the concentration of  H  in the solution equals the initial acid concentration.

### 16.3 Titrations and Buffers

■ An acid–base titration is called a neutralization reaction.
■ In a titration a measured volume of a standard solution (titrant) is added to the solution being analyzed (analyte).
■ The titration is stopped as close to the stoichiometric point (equivalence point) as possible as marked by an indicator or pH meter.
■ A buffered solution is a solution that resists a change in its pH when an acid or base is added.
■ Buffered solutions contain a weak acid and its conjugate base.

### The Characteristics of a Buffer
1. The solution contains a weak acid HA and its conjugate base  A .
2. The buffer resists changes in pH by reacting with any added  H  or OH so that these ions do not accumulate.
3. Any added  H  reacts with the base A . H  (aq)  A (aq) n HA(aq)
4. Any added O H  reacts with the weak acid HA.OH (aq)  HA(aq) n H2 O(l )  A (aq)

Equilibrium
Chemical equilibrium



### 17.1 Reaction Rates and Equilibrium

■ Collision model for chemical reactions
    • Reactants must collide to react.
    • A certain threshold energy (the activation energy,  Ea) must be supplied by the collision for a reaction to occur.
■ A catalyst
    • Speeds up a reaction without being consumed
    • Provides a new pathway for the reaction that has a smaller  Ea
    • Enzymes are biological catalysts.

■ Chemical equilibrium is established when a chemical reaction is carried out in a closed vessel.
    • The concentrations of both reactants and products remain constant over time.
    • Equilibrium is a highly dynamic state on the microscopic level.
◆ Forward rate = reverse rate
    • In homogeneous reactions all reactants and products are in the same phase.
    • In heterogeneous reactions one or more reactants or products are in different phases.

### 18.1 Electron Transfer Reactions

■ Oxidation–reduction reactions involve electron transfer.
    • Oxidation states are used to keep track of electrons.
    • Oxidation—an increase in oxidation state (a loss of electrons)
    • Reduction—a decrease in oxidation state (a gain of electrons)
    • The oxidizing agent accepts electrons.
    • The reducing agent furnishes electrons.

### 18.2 Balancing Oxidation–Reduction Reactions

■ Balancing oxidation–reduction reactions can be accomplished by two methods:
    • Inspection (trial and error)
    • Half-reactions

### 18.3 Electrochemistry and Its Applications

■ Electrochemistry is the study of the interchange of chemical and electrical energy.
■ A galvanic cell is a device for converting chemical energy to electrical energy.
    • Consists of separate compartments for the oxidizing and reducing agents which are connected by a salt bridge and a wire
    • Anode—electrode at which oxidation occurs
    • Cathode—electrode at which reduction occurs
    • Battery—a galvanic cell or a group of cells connected together
■ Corrosion is the oxidation of metals to form mainly oxides and sulfides.
    • Some metals, such as aluminum, protect themselves with their oxide coating.
    • Corrosion of iron can be prevented by coatings, by alloying, and cathodic protection.
■ Electrolysis is the use of electrical energy to produce a chemical change.

■ Radioactivity is the spontaneous decomposition of a nucleus to form another nucleus.
    • Atomic number (Z) and atomic mass number (A) are both conserved in a radioactive decay.
    • Types of radioactive decay
        ◆ Alpha () particle production
        ◆ Beta () particle production
        ◆ Gamma () ray production
        ◆ Electron capture
        ◆ Positron (  ) production
    • Often a series of decays occurs until a stable nucleus is formed.
    • Radioactivity is detected by instruments such as the Geiger–Müller counter.
    • Half-life for a radioactive nucleus is the time required for half of the sample to decay.
■ Nuclear transformations change one atom into another by particle bombardment.

### 19.2 Application of Radioactivity

■ Radiocarbon or carbon-14 dating—objects containing carbon can be dated by measuring their 146C content.
■ Radiotracers are radioactive nuclides that can be introduced into an organism and traced by observing their radioactive decay.

■ Organic chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties.
■ Most organic compounds contain chains or rings of carbon atoms.
■ Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen.
    • Alkanes are called saturated hydrocarbons because they have four single bonds (the maximum possible) to each carbon.
        ◆ General formula  CnH2n2
        ◆ Exhibit structural isomerism: molecules with the same atoms but different arrangements of atoms
        ◆ Undergo substitution reactions
            • Petroleum is a mixture of hydrocarbons formed by decay of ancient marine organisms which is used as a source of energy.
