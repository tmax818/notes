I saw this [[https://youtu.be/8SEDCUaL0hY][video]] and was taken by the notion that teaching can be constured as story telling. At this [[https://youtu.be/8SEDCUaL0hY?t=974][point]] about laziness resonated. Layziness for a comic is not doing the work off stage. I think the same is true of teaching.
