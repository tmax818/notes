* introduction


This will be the single repository(bucket) for my notes...I think. Reading notes. Fleeting notes. Who's going to read it but me?

This line was written on GitHub...

The last line is significant because it is another means of capturing ideas.

On Github too... 

I am thinking that the readme will serve as a place for fleeting notes. It seems to be the easiest to modify.
